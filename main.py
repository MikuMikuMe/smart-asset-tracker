Creating a full-fledged smart asset tracker with real-time capabilities is a complex task and would require integration with financial data APIs for real-time data. Below is a simplified version of such a program. This Python script will track and analyze the performance of a small set of assets using the `yfinance` library to fetch real-time financial data. It provides a basic structure for error handling and tracking, and it can be extended further to meet scalability and more advanced analytical needs.

### Prerequisites
1. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance
   ```

### Python Code

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import time
import logging

# Setup logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SmartAssetTracker:
    def __init__(self, symbols):
        """
        Initialize the tracker with a list of asset symbols.
        
        Parameters:
            symbols (list): A list of ticker symbols to track, e.g., ['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL']
        """
        self.symbols = symbols

### Explanation

- **Logging:** The script uses `logging` for displaying information, warnings, and errors, which helps in tracing the flow of the script and understanding potential issues.
- **Data Fetching:** The script uses `yfinance` to fetch real-time stock data and analyzes it. It handles exceptions that might occur during data fetching.
- **Performance Calculation:** Calculates the percentage change between the open and close prices for each stock, assuming the data is available.
- **Scalability Considerations:** This basic tracker fetches data every 60 seconds, which can be configured as needed. For more extensive data sets or complex analysis, implement parallel processing and leverage cloud-based solutions or databases.

Note: This script provides a basic structure. More robust solutions would utilize multi-threading, handle many more assets, employ data storage and querying systems, or integrate more complex financial analysis and models.
